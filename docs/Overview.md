**GrapeCity Documents** is a cross-platform solution for document management
which aims to provide a universal document, editor and viewer solution for all
popular document formats.

**GrapeCity Documents for PDF** library, referred to as **GcPdf**, is a part of
GrapeCity Documents that handles majority of the PDF related needs as it
conforms to a large part of [Adobe PDF specification
1.7](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf).
The extensive library supported on .NET Standard 2.0, can be used to read,
create, modify and save PDF files without using any external tool like Adobe
Acrobat. It offers a rich feature set that allows developers to create PDF files
with advanced font support and features, images, graphics, barcode, annotations,
outlines, stamps, watermark and more. It also allows the developers to make
changes at the document level; for example, working with document properties,
page size, orientation, security and signatures, file compression, generating
linearized PDF document are few to mention. Moreover, all these features are
fully supported on Windows, Linux, and MAC systems.

In addition, GcPdf provides full text support in .NET Standard 2.0, despite the
fact that major classes related to text and image are missing in .NET Core. This
makes it a cross-platform solution for many developers looking for a PDF library
to generate PDF files for multi-device applications.
